		<h1>About this project</h1>
		<p>In the summer of 2002, I created the first version of a content management system (then unimaginatively called "Content Manager") to replace the college newspaper's static HTML site. It was my first project using PHP/MySQL. The site ran an iteration of PacerCMS up until December of 2006. While the site has since moved on to College Publisher, there was some data that was "lost" in that migration. Examples of missing data include the original article author name and related photos and images.</p>
		<p>The contents of this site are wholly owned by <em><a href="http://utmpacer.com">The Pacer</a></em> and the <a href="http://www.utm.edu/organizations/stupubs/">UT Martin Office of Student Publications</a>.</p>
